## History
     In the past the news and reporting have been pillars of democracy and the modern society. Since the advent of the printing press the news has made it simple for all people to stay informed and connected. In the early 19th century journalism was used to expose horrid business practices and advocate for better rights. Inventions such as the radio, television and internet have made it easier to create, distribute and consume the news.
